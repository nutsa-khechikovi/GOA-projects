                <h2><i>Sweater Weather</i></h2>
                <p>“Sweater Weather” is the lead single from The Neighbourhood’s 2012 debut EP I’m Sorry…, and also features on their
                    debut full-length album I Love You.
                    “Sweater Weather” is one of The Neighbourhood’s most successful tracks, peaking at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts
                    in December 2013 and spent 11 weeks at #1 on the Alternative charts. The music video for the track reached 100 million
                    views in December 2015, when the video was merely two years old.
                    “Sweater Weather” is the first song the band had ever written together, composed during their first practice, around a
                    year prior to its release. Frontman Jesse Rutherford recalled the historic day to Schon! in December 2015:
                    It was just a really special moment and it felt special before anybody said it was special. When we first wrote it and
                    showed our families and some friends that we trusted their opinion around town or whatever, it was just a different
                    reaction than we’d ever seen someone have to our music.</p>

                <h2><i>Daddy Issues</i></h2>
                <p>“Daddy Issues” peers into the relationship between frontman Jesse Rutherford and his late father.
                    Lyrical content from “1 of Those Weaks,” “R.I.P. 2 My Youth,” and “Greetings From Califournia,” as well as a tweet
                    Rutherford made in 2014, mention the passing of his father.Although the song refers to his father several times, it
                    should still be known that he talks about the effects of growing up without a father specifically for younger contemporary
                    women.</p>

                <h2><i>Daddy Issues</i></h2>
                <p>On October 26th, 2018, the band announced via social media that a remix of “Daddy Issues” featuring Syd would be released
                    on Monday the 29th. Strangely, the announcement posts were deleted and the remix was not released. The song was leaked
                    online shortly after this ordeal, and would go on to be a viral “sound” on TikTok. On August 8th, 2021, the song was
                    officially released on streaming services.</p>
