        <p>Georgia is a country in Eastern Europe and West Asia. It is part of the Caucasus region, bounded by the Black Sea to 
            the west, Russia to the north and northeast, Turkey to the southwest, Armenia to the south, and Azerbaijan to the southeast. Georgia 
            covers an area of 69,700 square kilometres (26,900 sq mi). It has a population of 3.7 million, of which over a third live
            in the capital and largest city, Tbilisi. Georgians, who are native to the region, constitute a majority of the country's population 
            and are its titular nation.
            Georgia has been inhabited since prehistory, hosting the world's earliest known sites of winemaking, gold mining, and textiles.
            The classical era saw the emergence of several kingdoms, such as Colchis and Iberia, that formed the nucleus of the modern Georgian
            state. In the early fourth century, Georgians officially adopted Christianity, which contributed to their unification under the 
            Kingdom of Georgia. Georgia reached its Golden Age during the High Middle Ages under the reigns of King David IV and Queen Tamar. 
            Beginning in the 15th century, the kingdom declined and disintegrated under pressure from various regional powers, including the 
            Mongols, the Ottoman Empire, and Persia, before being gradually annexed into the Russian Empire starting in 1801.
            After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Georgia briefly emerged as an independent republic under German protection,[24] but was invaded 
            and annexed by the Red Army in 1921, becoming one of the republics of the Soviet Union. In the 1980s, an independence movement grew
            quickly, leading to Georgia's secession from the Soviet Union in April 1991. For much of the subsequent decade, the country endured economic crises, political instability, and secessionist wars in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Following the peaceful Rose Revolution in 2003, Georgia strongly pursued a pro-Western foreign policy, introducing a series of democratic and economic reforms aimed at integration into the European Union and NATO. This Western orientation led to worsening relations with Russia, culminating in the Russo-Georgian War of 2008 and continued Russian occupation of parts of Georgia.
            Georgia is a representative democracy governed as a unitary parliamentary republic. It is a developing country with a very
            high Human Development Index and an emerging market economy. Sweeping economic reforms since 2003 have resulted in one of the freest 
            business climates in the world, greater economic freedom and transparency, and among the fastest rates of GDP growth. In 2018,
            Georgia became the second country to legalize cannabis, and the first former socialist state to do so. Georgia is a member of 
            numerous international organizations, including the Council of Europe, Eurocontrol, BSEC, GUAM, Energy Community. As part of the 
            Association Trio, Georgia is an official candidate for membership in the European Union. Since October 2024, Georgia is immersed
            in a deep political crisis.</p>
