        <p>Alternative rock (or just "alt rock") is a broad genre of rock music that emerged in the 1980s and became hugely popular in the
        1990s. It's called “alternative” because it originally described music that was an alternative to the mainstream rock of the time.</p>
        <p><i>the vibes: </i>Think moody, expressive, and sometimes dark — but always with a cool, creative edge. It’s the kind of music
        that feels personal and a bit outside the norm.</p>
