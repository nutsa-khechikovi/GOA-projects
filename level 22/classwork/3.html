        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <p><b>Michelangelo: </b>Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475 – 18 February 1564), known mononymously as
            Michelangelo, was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance. Born in the Republic of
            Florence, his work was inspired by models from classical antiquity and had a lasting influence on Western art. Michelangelo's
            creative abilities and mastery in a range of artistic arenas define him as an archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and
            elder contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci. Given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences,
            Michelangelo is one of the best-documented artists of the 16th century. He was lauded by contemporary biographers as the most
            accomplished artist of his era.
            Michelangelo achieved fame early. Two of his best-known works, the Pietà and David, were sculpted before the age of 30. Although
            he did not consider himself a painter, Michelangelo created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art:
            the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and The Last Judgment on its altar wall. His design of the
            Laurentian Library pioneered Mannerist architecture. At the age of 71, he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the
            architect of St. Peter's Basilica. Michelangelo transformed the plan so that the Western end was finished to his design, as was
            the dome, with some modification, after his death.</p>
