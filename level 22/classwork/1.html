    <h2>Leonardo da Vinci</h2>
    <h3>ABOUT</h3>
    <p><b>Leonardo da Vinci: </b>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci(15 April 1452 â€“ 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance
        who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect. While his fame initially rested
        on his achievements as a painter, he has also become known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of
        subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and palaeontology. Leonardo is widely regarded to have been
        a genius who epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his collective works comprise a contribution to later generations of
        artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary Michelangelo.
        Born out of wedlock to a successful notary and a lower-class woman in, or near, Vinci, he was educated in Florence by the Italian
        painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio. He began his career in the city, but then spent much time in the service of Ludovico
        Sforza in Milan. Later, he worked in Florence and Milan again, as well as briefly in Rome, all while attracting a large following of
        imitators and students. Upon the invitation of Francis I, he spent his last three years in France, where he died in 1519. Since his
        death, there has not been a time where his achievements, diverse interests, personal life, and empirical thinking have failed to
        incite interest and admiration, making him a frequent namesake and subject in culture.</p>
