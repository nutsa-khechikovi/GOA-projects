    <h1>3 FAMOUSE PAINTERS</h1>
    <h2>Leonardo da Vinci</h2>
    <h3>ABOUT</h3>
    <p><b>Leonardo da Vinci: </b>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci(15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance
        who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect. While his fame initially rested
        on his achievements as a painter, he has also become known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of
        subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and palaeontology. Leonardo is widely regarded to have been
        a genius who epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his collective works comprise a contribution to later generations of
        artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary Michelangelo.
        Born out of wedlock to a successful notary and a lower-class woman in, or near, Vinci, he was educated in Florence by the Italian
        painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio. He began his career in the city, but then spent much time in the service of Ludovico
        Sforza in Milan. Later, he worked in Florence and Milan again, as well as briefly in Rome, all while attracting a large following of
        imitators and students. Upon the invitation of Francis I, he spent his last three years in France, where he died in 1519. Since his
        death, there has not been a time where his achievements, diverse interests, personal life, and empirical thinking have failed to
        incite interest and admiration, making him a frequent namesake and subject in culture.</p>

        <h2>Vincent van Gogh</h2>
        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <P><B>Vincent van Gogh: </B>Vincent Willem van Gogh(30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among
            the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created approximately 2,100
            artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. His oeuvre includes landscapes,
            still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits, most of which are characterised by bold colours and dramatic brushwork that contributed
            to the rise of expressionism in modern art. Van Gogh's work was only beginning to gain critical attention before he died from a
            self-inflicted gunshot at age 37. During his lifetime, only one of Van Gogh's paintings, The Red Vineyard, was sold.
            Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet and thoughtful, but showed signs of mental
            instability. As a young man, he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London.
            He turned to religion and spent time as a missionary in southern Belgium. Later he drifted into ill-health and solitude. He was
            keenly aware of modernist trends in art and, while back with his parents, took up painting in 1881. His younger brother, Theo,
            supported him financially, and the two of them maintained a long correspondence.</P>

        <h2>Michelangelo</h2>
        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <p><b>Michelangelo: </b>Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475 – 18 February 1564), known mononymously as
            Michelangelo, was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance. Born in the Republic of
            Florence, his work was inspired by models from classical antiquity and had a lasting influence on Western art. Michelangelo's
            creative abilities and mastery in a range of artistic arenas define him as an archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and
            elder contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci. Given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences,
            Michelangelo is one of the best-documented artists of the 16th century. He was lauded by contemporary biographers as the most
            accomplished artist of his era.
            Michelangelo achieved fame early. Two of his best-known works, the Pietà and David, were sculpted before the age of 30. Although
            he did not consider himself a painter, Michelangelo created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art:
            the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and The Last Judgment on its altar wall. His design of the
            Laurentian Library pioneered Mannerist architecture. At the age of 71, he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the
            architect of St. Peter's Basilica. Michelangelo transformed the plan so that the Western end was finished to his design, as was
            the dome, with some modification, after his death.</p>
