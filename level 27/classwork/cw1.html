        <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
            It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
            and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may
            be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text
            such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle
            brackets. Tags such as directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and  surround and provide information about
            document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of
            the page.
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.
            The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML
            and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A
            form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the  element, together with JavaScript.</p>

            In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use
            and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[4] Berners-Lee specified HTML
            and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau
            collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990,
            Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[5]
            The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[6] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim
            Berners-Lee in late 1991.[7][8] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the
            hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by CERN SGML, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based
            documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[9]
            HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible
            web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be
            altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO
            technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that
            used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These
            formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept 
            generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate
            structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
            Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force
            (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)"
            Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax.[10][11] The
            draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding
            in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing
            Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like
            tables and fill-out forms.[12]
            After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group
            completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations
            should be based.[13]
            Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have
            been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[14] In 2000, HTML became an
            international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In
            2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint
            deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.[15]
            HTML version timeline
            HTML 2
            November 24, 1995
            HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:
            November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)
            May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)
            August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)
            January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)
            HTML 3
            January 14, 1997
            HTML 3.2[16] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C,
            as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[17]
            Initially code-named "Wilbur",[18] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary
            extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were
            omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.[14] A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML
            was standardized 14 months later in MathML.
            HTML 4
            December 18, 1997
            HTML 4.0[19] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:
            Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden
            Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed
            Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.
            Initially code-named "Cougar",[18] HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but also sought to phase
            out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application
            conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.[20]
            April 24, 1998
            HTML 4.0[21] was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
            December 24, 1999
            HTML 4.01[22] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata[23] were
            published on May 12, 2001.
            May 2000
            ISO/IEC 15445:2000[24] ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard.[25] In the
            ISO, this standard is in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document 
            escription and processing languages).[24]
            After HTML 4.01, there were no new versions of HTML for many years, as the development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML
            occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group.
            HTML 5
            Main article: HTML5
            October 28, 2014
            HTML5[26] was published as a W3C Recommendation.[27]
            November 1, 2016
            HTML 5.1[28] was published as a W3C Recommendation.[29][30]
            December 14, 2017
            HTML 5.2[31] was published as a W3C Recommendation.[32][33]
            HTML draft version timeline
            October 1991
            HTML Tags,[7] an informal CERN document listing 18 HTML tags, was first mentioned in public.
            June 1992
            First informal draft of the HTML DTD,[34] with seven subsequent revisions (July 15, August 6, August 18, November 17,
            November 19, November 20, November 22)[35][36][37]
            November 1992
            HTML DTD 1.1 (the first with a version number, based on RCS revisions, which start with 1.1 rather than 1.0), an informal
            draft[37]
            June 1993
            Hypertext Markup Language[38] was published by the IETF IIIR Working Group as an Internet Draft (a rough proposal for a standard).
            It was replaced by a second version[39] one month later.
            November 1993
            HTML+ was published by the IETF as an Internet Draft and was a competing proposal to the Hypertext Markup Language draft. It
            expired in July 1994.[40]
            November 1994
            First draft (revision 00) of HTML 2.0 published by IETF itself[41] (called as "HTML 2.0" from revision 02[42]), that finally
            led to the publication of RFC 1866 in November 1995.[43]
            April 1995 (authored March 1995)
            HTML 3.0[44] was proposed as a standard to the IETF, but the proposal expired five months later (28 September 1995)[45] without
            further action. It included many of the capabilities that were in Raggett's HTML+ proposal, such as support for tables, text flow
            around figures, and the display of complex mathematical formulas.[45]
            W3C began development of its own Arena browser as a test bed for HTML 3 and Cascading Style Sheets,[46][47][48] but HTML 3.0 did
            not succeed for several reasons. The draft was considered very large at 150 pages and the pace of browser development, as well as
            the number of interested parties, had outstripped the resources of the IETF.[14] Browser vendors, including Microsoft and Netscape
            at the time, chose to implement different subsets of HTML 3's draft features as well as to introduce their own extensions to
            it.[14] (See browser wars.) These included extensions to control stylistic aspects of documents, contrary to the "belief [of
            academic engineering community] that such things as text color, background texture, font size, and font face were definitely 
            utside the scope of a language when their only intent was to specify how a document would be organized."[14] Dave Raggett, who
            has been a W3C Fellow for many years, has commented for example: "To a certain extent, Microsoft built its business on the Web
            by extending HTML features."[14]</p>
