    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Facebook is a social media and social networking service owned by the American technology conglomerate Meta. Created in 2004 by Mark
        Zuckerberg with four other Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris
        Hughes, its name derives from the face book directories often given to American university students. Membership was initially
        limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities. Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone to
        register from 13 years old, except in the case of a handful of nations, where the age requirement is 14 years. As of December
        2023, Facebook claimed almost 3.07 billion monthly active users worldwide. As of November 2024, Facebook ranked as the
        third-most-visited website in the world, with 23% of its traffic coming from the United States. It was the most downloaded
        mobile app of the 2010s.
        Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After
        registering, users can create a profile revealing personal information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia
        which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their friend or, with different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also
        communicate directly with each other with Messenger, edit messages (within 15 minutes after sending), join common-interest
        groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow.
        Facebook has often been criticized over issues such as user privacy (as with the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal),
        political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S. elections) and mass surveillance. The company has also been subject to criticism
        over its psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and over content such as fake news, conspiracy theories,
        copyright infringement, and hate speech. Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content,
        as well as exaggerating its number of users to appeal to advertisers.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The history of Facebook traces its growth from a college networking site to a global social networking service.
        While attending Phillips Exeter in the early 2000's, Zuckerberg met Kris Tillery. Tillery, a one-time project collaborator with
        Zuckerberg, would create a school-based social networking project called Photo Address Book. Photo Address Book was a digital face
    book, created through a linked database composed of student information derived from the official records of the Exeter student council.
    The database contained linkages such as name, dorm-specific landline numbers, and student headshots.
        Mark Zuckerberg built a website called "Facemash" in 2003 while attending Harvard University. The site was comparable to Hot or Not
        and used photos from online face books, asking users to choose the 'hotter' person". Zuckerberg was reported and faced expulsion,
        but the charges were dropped.
        A "face book" is a student directory featuring photos and personal information. In January 2004, Zuckerberg coded a new site known
        as "TheFacebook", stating, "It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available ... the
        benefits are many." Zuckerberg met with Harvard student Eduardo Saverin, and each agreed to invest $1,000. On February 4, 2004,
        Zuckerberg launched "TheFacebook".
        Membership was initially restricted to students of Harvard College. Dustin Moskovitz, Andrew McCollum, and Chris Hughes joined
        Zuckerberg to help manage the growth of the site. It became available successively to most universities in the US and Canada.
        In 2006, Facebook opened to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid email address. Facebook introduced key features
        like the News Feed, which became central to user engagement. By late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 pages on which companies promoted
        themselves. Facebook had surpassed MySpace in global traffic and became the world's most popular social media platform. Microsoft
        announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240 million ($364 million in 2024 dollars), giving Facebook an
        implied value of around $15 billion ($22.7 billion in 2024 dollars). Facebook focused on generating revenue through targeted
        advertising based on user data, a model that drove its rapid financial growth. In 2012, Facebook went public with one of the largest
        IPOs in tech history. Acquisitions played a significant role in Facebook's dominance. In 2012, it purchased Instagram, followed by
        WhatsApp and Oculus VR in 2014, extending its influence beyond social networking into messaging and virtual reality.
        The Facebookâ€“Cambridge Analytica data scandal in 2018 revealed misuse of user data to influence elections, sparking global outcry
        and leading to regulatory fines and hearings. Facebook's role in global events, including its use in organizing movements like the
        Arab Spring and its impact on events like the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar, highlighted its dual nature as a tool for empowerment
        and harm. In 2021, Facebook rebranded as Meta, reflecting its shift toward building the "metaverse" and focusing on virtual reality
        and augmented reality technologies.</p>
