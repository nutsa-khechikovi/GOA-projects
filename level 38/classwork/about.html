        <p>The word geek is a slang term originally used to describe eccentric or non-mainstream people; in current use, <br>the word typically connotes an expert or enthusiast obsessed with a hobby or intellectual pursuit. <br>In the past, it had a generally pejorative meaning of a "peculiar person, especially one who is perceived <br>to be overly intellectual, unfashionable, boring, or socially awkward". In the 21st century, <br>it was reclaimed and used by many people, especially members of some fandoms, as a positive term.
           <br>Some use the term self-referentially without malice or as a source of pride, often referring simply to <br>"someone who is interested in a subject (usually intellectual or complex) for its own sake".
